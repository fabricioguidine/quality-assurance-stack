# Equivalence Partitioning

**Equivalence Partitioning (EP)** is a **black-box test design technique** used to reduce the number of test cases while maintaining effective test coverage. It works by dividing input data into **equivalence classes**, where each class is expected to be treated the same by the system.

> 🧠 The idea: If one value in a class works, others should too.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- To avoid redundant test cases
- To identify representative values from input ranges
- To improve test efficiency by grouping similar inputs

---

## 📦 How It Works

Inputs are divided into:
- **Valid equivalence classes** (expected to be accepted)
- **Invalid equivalence classes** (expected to be rejected)

Test cases are then created by selecting **one value from each class**.

---

## 🧪 Example

Suppose a system accepts ages from **18 to 60**.

| Class Type   | Input Range        | Representative Test Value |
|--------------|--------------------|----------------------------|
| Valid        | 18–60              | 30                         |
| Invalid      | Less than 18       | 17                         |
| Invalid      | Greater than 60    | 65                         |

No need to test every value. Just test one from each class.

## ✅ Benefits

- Reduces the number of test cases significantly
- Easy to apply in early test planning stages
- Complements other techniques like Boundary Value Analysis

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Assumes all values in a class are handled the same
- May not detect **edge-specific** defects
- Not suitable for complex logic-based validations

## 🔁 When to Use

| Scenario                          | Apply EP? |
|-----------------------------------|-----------|
| Numeric inputs with a valid range | ✅         |
| Input fields with categories      | ✅         |
| Format-specific data (e.g., regex)| ❌         |
| Logical workflows                 | ❌         |

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

- Identify **both valid and invalid partitions**
- Pair with **Boundary Value Analysis** for robust coverage
- Use it in early test case design or during requirement review
