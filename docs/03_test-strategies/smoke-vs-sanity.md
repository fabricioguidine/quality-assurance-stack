# Smoke vs Sanity Testing

Both are quick verification types, but used in different contexts.

## 🔥 Smoke Testing

- **Surface-level check** of major functionality
- Performed after a new build
- Ensures system is testable

---

## 🧠 Sanity Testing

- **Focused check** after a minor code change
- Confirms a specific bug fix or feature
- Avoids retesting everything
