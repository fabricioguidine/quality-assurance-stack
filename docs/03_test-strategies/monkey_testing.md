# Monkey Testing

**Monkey Testing** is a type of software testing where the application is tested by **providing random, unexpected, or invalid inputs** to check its robustness and ability to handle crashes or exceptions.

> 🐒 Named metaphorically, the idea is: “Give a monkey a device and see what happens.”

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Uncover crashes or abnormal behavior** by stressing the system with unpredictable actions.
- Verify that the system doesn’t break under **random or chaotic user interaction**.

---

## 🧪 How It Works

In Monkey Testing, either a tool or human tester interacts with the system in a **randomized and unstructured** manner:
- Clicking random buttons
- Entering invalid data
- Navigating randomly through screens
- Using hardware buttons, gestures, or shaking the device

## 📦 Types of Monkey Testing

| Type             | Description                                                        |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Dumb Monkey**   | No knowledge of the application; acts randomly                    |
| **Smart Monkey**  | Has some knowledge of the application’s workflow and logic        |

- **Dumb Monkey** is great for stress/crash testing.
- **Smart Monkey** can simulate realistic unexpected user behaviors with context.

## 🛠 Common Tools

- **Android Monkey Tool** – For random UI event generation on Android apps
- **MonkeyTalk / Appium** – With custom scripting for semi-random behavior
- **Gremlins.js** – Random testing on web UIs

---

## ✅ Benefits

- Can reveal **critical crashes** or **memory leaks**
- Good for **resilience and stability testing**
- Doesn’t require complex test planning
- Works well in combination with other techniques

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **Low reproducibility** – Hard to reproduce bugs without detailed logs
- **Low coverage** – Not suitable for validating requirements
- Inefficient for **business logic testing**

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

- Use Monkey Testing for:
  - Mobile apps
  - UI-heavy applications
  - Systems that must handle user unpredictability
- Always **collect logs and crash reports**
- Combine with **structured testing** (e.g., exploratory, regression)

## 📝 When to Use Monkey Testing

| Situation                     | Recommended? |
|------------------------------|--------------|
| Early-stage builds            | ✅            |
| Production validation         | ❌            |
| Usability or UI stability     | ✅            |
| Compliance or requirement checks | ❌        |

## ✅ Summary

| Trait             | Value                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Testing style     | Random, unstructured                  |
| Goal              | Discover crashes and instability      |
| Test design       | No formal test cases                  |
| Best for          | Crash resistance, stress testing      |
