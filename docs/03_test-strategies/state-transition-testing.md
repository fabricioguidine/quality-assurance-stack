# State Transition Testing

**State Transition Testing** is a **black-box test design technique** used to validate how a system behaves when it transitions from one state to another in response to events or conditions.

> 🧠 If your system has **states, events, and transitions**, this technique is for you.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- To ensure that a system transitions correctly from one state to another
- To verify valid and invalid state transitions
- To detect missing or incorrect transitions

---

## 📋 Key Concepts

- **State**: A condition or situation in which the system can exist (e.g., Logged In, Locked)
- **Event**: An input or action that causes a transition (e.g., enter password, click logout)
- **Transition**: The movement from one state to another
- **Action**: The outcome or response after a transition

---

## 🧪 Example: Login System

### States:
- Logged Out
- Logged In
- Locked

### Events:
- Enter correct password
- Enter wrong password
- Logout

### Transitions Table:

| Current State | Event                  | Next State | Action               |
|---------------|------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| Logged Out    | Correct password        | Logged In  | Show dashboard       |
| Logged Out    | 3 wrong passwords       | Locked     | Show locked screen   |
| Logged In     | Logout                  | Logged Out | Show login screen    |
| Locked        | Correct password        | Locked     | Show error message   |

## ✅ Benefits

- Clearly identifies valid and invalid transitions
- Ideal for systems with **workflow, lifecycle, or session-based logic**
- Helps design **complete and meaningful test cases**

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Requires well-defined states and transitions
- Complex systems may result in large state diagrams
- Not suitable for purely input-driven or stateless functions

## 🔁 When to Use

| Use Case                       | Recommended? |
|--------------------------------|--------------|
| Login/logout workflows         | ✅            |
| Finite state machines (FSMs)   | ✅            |
| UI navigational flows          | ✅            |
| Data validation routines       | ❌            |

## 🛠 Best Practices

- Start by drawing a **state diagram**
- Convert the diagram into a **transition table**
- Include **positive and negative transitions**
- Validate **undefined or forbidden transitions**
