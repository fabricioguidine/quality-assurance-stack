# Decision Table Testing

**Decision Table Testing** is a **black-box test design technique** that uses tables to represent complex business rules and their outcomes. It's especially useful when the output depends on **multiple conditions or combinations of inputs**.

> 🧠 Think of it as a structured way to cover **"if-this-then-that"** logic thoroughly.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- To ensure **all combinations of inputs** are covered
- To validate business logic and rule-based systems
- To simplify complex decision-making into **clear test cases**

---

## 📋 What is a Decision Table?

A **decision table** contains:
- **Conditions:** Input variables or criteria
- **Actions:** Expected results or outputs
- **Rules:** All possible combinations of conditions and their corresponding actions

## 🧪 Simple Example

### Scenario: Eligibility for a loan

| Rule # | Age > 18 | Income > $40K | Has Debt | Eligible for Loan |
|--------|----------|---------------|----------|-------------------|
| 1      | Yes      | Yes           | No       | Yes               |
| 2      | Yes      | Yes           | Yes      | No                |
| 3      | Yes      | No            | Any      | No                |
| 4      | No       | Any           | Any      | No                |

From this table, we can derive **four test cases** to validate all logic paths.

## ✅ Benefits

- Ensures **complete test coverage** of input combinations
- Clarifies complex logic for both technical and non-technical stakeholders
- Easy to maintain and update as business rules evolve
- Ideal for **functional and acceptance testing**

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Can grow large if many conditions exist
- Not suitable for UI or layout-based testing
- Requires clear business rules up front

## 🧩 When to Use

| Scenario                                  | Recommended? |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Rule-based decision systems               | ✅            |
| Insurance, banking, or e-commerce logic   | ✅            |
| UI layout or usability checks             | ❌            |
| Workflow or state transitions             | ❌ (use State Transition Testing) |

## 🧠 Best Practices

- Keep decision tables **simple and focused** on one functionality at a time
- Combine with **Equivalence Partitioning** for efficient test case design
- Use tools or spreadsheets to manage large tables
- Ensure **traceability** between rules and test cases

## 📌 Summary

| Attribute          | Value                                   |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Technique Type     | Black-box                               |
| Focus              | Input combinations and business logic   |
| Output             | Structured test cases                   |
| Best For           | Business rules and conditional logic    |
