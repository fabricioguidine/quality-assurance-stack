# Use Case Testing

**Use Case Testing** is a **black-box test design technique** that derives test cases from real-world **user interactions with the system**. It focuses on validating **functional flows** that users are expected to perform.

> 🧠 This technique helps ensure the system behaves correctly from the user’s perspective.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- To verify that the system handles **end-to-end user scenarios** correctly
- To ensure the application meets **business and functional requirements**
- To test how users will actually **interact** with the product

---

## 📋 What is a Use Case?

A **use case** describes how a user interacts with a system to achieve a specific goal. Each use case includes:
- **Actor** (user or external system)
- **Preconditions**
- **Basic flow** (main success path)
- **Alternative flows** (optional paths)
- **Exceptions** (error or failure paths)

---

## 🧪 Example: E-commerce Checkout

### Use Case: Place an Order

- **Actor**: Registered User  
- **Preconditions**: User is logged in, cart has items  
- **Main Flow**:
  1. User clicks “Checkout”
  2. Enters shipping info
  3. Selects payment method
  4. Confirms order
- **Alternative Flow**: Apply discount code
- **Exception Flow**: Payment failure → show error message

From this, we can derive multiple **test cases** based on:
- Normal checkout
- Checkout with discount
- Checkout with invalid payment method

## ✅ Benefits

- Aligns testing with **real user behavior**
- Improves **stakeholder communication**
- Helps identify **critical business scenarios**
- Useful for **acceptance testing**

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Requires clear and complete use case documentation
- May not capture **low-level or edge case bugs**
- Maintenance effort increases if business processes change frequently

## 🔁 When to Use

| Situation                             | Use Case Testing? |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Testing business workflows            | ✅                |
| User acceptance testing (UAT)         | ✅                |
| Low-level input validation            | ❌                |
| Algorithm logic or state transitions  | ❌ (use other techniques) |

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

- Collaborate with **business analysts and stakeholders**
- Derive test cases from **basic, alternative, and exception flows**
- Prioritize **high-frequency** or **high-risk** use cases
- Combine with **exploratory and boundary testing** for depth

## 📌 Summary

| Attribute           | Value                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Technique Type      | Black-box                              |
| Focus               | Functional user journeys               |
| Test Basis          | Use case documents or user stories     |
| Best For            | End-to-end scenarios, UAT              |
