Understanding the difference between **Agile** and **Waterfall** testing models is key to selecting the right QA strategy for a project.

---

## 💧 Waterfall Testing

- Sequential, phase-based development
- Testing is done **after development**
- Requires full requirements upfront

### 🔻 Drawbacks:
- Late bug detection
- Limited adaptability

---

## 🔁 Agile Testing

- Iterative and incremental
- Testing happens **throughout development**
- Emphasizes collaboration (Dev + QA)

### ✅ Benefits:
- Early feedback
- Supports CI/CD
- Faster releases
