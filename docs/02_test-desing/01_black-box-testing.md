# Black Box Testing

**Black Box Testing** is a testing technique where the internal structure, design, or implementation of the item being tested is **not known** to the tester. The tester focuses on inputs and expected outputs without any knowledge of how the system processes the data.

## 🎯 Objective

To validate the **functionality** of the system as per requirements, regardless of how the system is built.

---

## 🧪 Characteristics

- Tests are based on **requirements and specifications**
- Focuses on **what** the system does, not **how**
- Often used in **functional**, **acceptance**, and **system testing**

---

## ✅ Common Techniques

- Equivalence Partitioning
- Boundary Value Analysis
- Decision Table Testing
- State Transition Testing
- Use Case Testing

---

## 📦 Advantages

- Test cases can be created **as soon as requirements are defined**
- **No coding knowledge** required
- Helps identify missing functionalities

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Cannot test **internal logic or paths**
- Limited to detecting **behavioral issues**, not structural ones
