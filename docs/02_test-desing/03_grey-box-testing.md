# Grey Box Testing

**Grey Box Testing** combines aspects of **black box** and **white box** testing. The tester has **partial knowledge** of the internal workings of the application, allowing for more effective testing at the interface and integration level.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To identify **defects from both internal logic and external behavior** using limited system knowledge.

---

## 🧪 Characteristics

- Useful in **integration testing**, **security testing**, and **penetration testing**
- Tester understands system architecture but not full implementation
- Strikes a **balance between functional and structural testing**

---

## 📦 Advantages

- Broader coverage than black box
- Better at identifying **data flow anomalies**
- Suitable for **API and web application testing**

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Requires access to some system internals (e.g., architecture docs, database)
- Can become complex depending on application depth
