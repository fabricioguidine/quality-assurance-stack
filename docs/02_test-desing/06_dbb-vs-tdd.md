Got it! Here's the **pure, copy-paste-ready markdown**, with **no embedded code blocks inside code blocks** (which was causing the formatting bugs earlier). You can **directly paste this into a `.md` file** and it will render correctly.

# BDD vs TDD

**BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)** and **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** are software development methodologies that emphasize testing early. While both aim to improve code quality, they differ in focus, language, and collaboration.

---

## 🔁 What is TDD?

**Test-Driven Development** involves writing **unit tests before the code**.

### TDD Workflow:
1. Write a failing test
2. Write the code to pass the test
3. Refactor the code
4. Repeat

### Example (TDD):
```python
def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
```

## 🎯 What is BDD?

**Behavior-Driven Development** extends TDD by writing tests in **natural language**, making them understandable to all team members including business stakeholders.

### BDD Workflow:
1. Define behavior in Gherkin (Given-When-Then)
2. Implement step definitions
3. Run tests and validate behavior

### Example (BDD in Gherkin):
```gherkin
Feature: Login

  Scenario: Successful login
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters valid credentials
    Then they should be redirected to the dashboard
```

## 🔍 Key Differences

| Feature              | TDD                            | BDD                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Focus                | Code functionality             | User behavior and requirements           |
| Language             | Programming language           | Natural language (Gherkin)               |
| Test type            | Unit tests                     | Acceptance and scenario-based tests      |
| Target audience      | Developers                     | Developers, QA, Product Owners           |
| Collaboration        | Low                            | High                                     |

## 🧠 When to Use Each

- Use **TDD** for internal logic, algorithms, and unit testing.
- Use **BDD** when validating user behavior, business rules, or when close collaboration is needed.

## ✅ Summary

| Practice | Focus Area                  | Language           | Best For                      |
|----------|-----------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| TDD      | Code correctness             | Programming        | Developers                    |
| BDD      | Behavioral correctness       | Natural (Gherkin)  | Cross-functional collaboration|

> 💡 Many teams use **TDD and BDD together** to cover both low-level and high-level testing needs.
