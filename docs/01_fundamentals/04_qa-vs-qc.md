# QA vs QC

In software engineering, the terms **Quality Assurance (QA)** and **Quality Control (QC)** are often used interchangeably, but they serve different purposes in the quality management process. Understanding their distinction is essential for establishing a robust quality framework.

## ‚úÖ What is QA (Quality Assurance)?

**Quality Assurance** is a **process-oriented** approach focused on **preventing defects** in software products. QA is proactive and involves the **systematic planning and implementation of processes** that ensure quality throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

### üîç Key Characteristics of QA:
- Prevents defects through process improvements
- Focuses on process definition, documentation, and standards
- Involves auditing, process monitoring, and compliance
- Conducted **before and during** development
- Includes activities like reviews, process audits, and training

### üõ† Examples of QA Activities:
- Creating test strategies and plans
- Defining coding standards
- Conducting process audits and root cause analysis
- Performing risk analysis and mitigation planning

## üß™ What is QC (Quality Control)?

**Quality Control** is a **product-oriented** approach that focuses on **identifying defects** in the actual software product. QC is reactive and involves activities that ensure the final deliverables meet quality standards and functional requirements.

### üîç Key Characteristics of QC:
- Detects defects through actual testing of the product
- Focuses on product validation and verification
- Involves executing test cases and reporting defects
- Conducted **after development is complete**
- Includes manual and automated testing processes

### üõ† Examples of QC Activities:
- Functional, integration, and system testing
- Regression and performance testing
- Logging and tracking defects in tools like JIRA
- Preparing test summary reports

| Feature / Aspect        | QA (Quality Assurance)                            | QC (Quality Control)                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**              | Process-oriented                                  | Product-oriented                                     |
| **Goal**               | Prevent defects                                   | Identify and fix defects                             |
| **Timing**             | Before and during development                     | After development is complete                        |
| **Responsibility**     | QA team, Process owners                           | Testers, QA Engineers                                |
| **Techniques Used**    | Audits, process improvement, standards enforcement| Testing (manual & automated), inspections            |
| **Nature**             | Proactive                                         | Reactive                                              |
| **Tools**              | Process checklists, audit reports                 | Test management and bug tracking tools (e.g., JIRA)  |

## üß† Key Takeaways

- **QA is about building it right**, while **QC is about checking if it's built right**.
- QA establishes the **framework and practices** for quality; QC ensures **those practices are followed and effective**.
- Both QA and QC are essential and **work hand-in-hand** to deliver high-quality software.
- A mature software organization integrates both QA and QC into its development lifecycle.

## üìò Best Practices

- Implement QA early in the SDLC to **reduce downstream defects and rework**.
- Empower QC with tools and environments that **support rigorous, repeatable testing**.
- Use metrics from QC (like defect density, test coverage) to inform QA improvements.
- Foster collaboration between QA and QC teams for **continuous quality enhancement**.
